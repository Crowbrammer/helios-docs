# Creation FAQ

An ever growing list of basic troubleshooting for questions we often get. 

### Where do I download Unreal Engine?

You will need to download Epic Launcher and pick up Unreal Engine 4.26 from the store.

### Where is the SDK?

The “Helios Template” is found in your Steam Library under “Tools”. 

DO NOT run this from Steam! Open it from the install location folder or the Epic Launcher.

### Why does Steam close Helios when I open the Helios Template?

Something to do with Steam thinking you are trying to run multiple copies of the game. If you want to have both open at the same time you need to open the Helios Template first, then open the game. 

### Why is the Helios Template taking forever to start?

Unreal Engine takes a long time to compile the Derived Data Cache the first time you run it. This can take anywhere from 10-30 minutes. Sometimes longer.

### How do I fix my fingers bending in the wrong direction?

Change the bone axis for the finger. 

### Why can no one see my new private avatar?

Go to the Steam Workshop page and make sure Visibility is set to “Public”
